# User

A user is a (usually natural) person that interacts with the Yolt API.
Users do not directly interact with the Yolt API, there's always a client in between Yolt and the [user](user.md) that acts 'on behalf of' the user.
In turn, the Yolt API interacts with [provider](provider.md)s on behalf of the client.
