# Client redirect URL

A client redirect URL is a convential URL that a client can configure.
The system then assigns it a uuid and stores it associated with that [client](client.md) .
Clients can subsequently use these URLs when onboarding with banks that support an oAuth2 flow.

See [function: add site](../functions/add-site.md) where the redirect URL concept is repeatedly used.
