## Tips for writing

- use one line per sentence, this makes the diffs pretty;
- use the active voice, avoid the passive voice;
- use one file per concept, function, process, etc.;
- make no assumptions about prior (domain) knowledge;
- explain things from first principles;
- do make use of copious cross references;
